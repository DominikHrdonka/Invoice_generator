# Things to be done:

# DBs
- create function to open/create the given DB and then use it across the code


# Invoice and order numbers
    - could make these more dynamic. E.G. reset the number once current_year changes.
# QR
- add function to generate unique QR code
- place the QR code in the document

# Concepts
- make it able to create concepts (storing incomplete files??)

# Clients
- align displayed data in treeview to center (??)

# Summary
- display amounts in a Czech-friendly format (e.g. 1 000,50)
        
- 
- SUMMARY ACCORDING TO THE SELECTED YEAR
    - DB
            -
            - maybe make a filter or a search bar??? 

- INVOICED THIS YEAR
    - use Czech format for displaying numbers

# json_data
- make shared_data_dictionary more dynamic, so that it resets the next_invoice_num and next_order_num when current_year changes

# Web migration
- transform the program to a web app?
- create a fork -- one stayes dektip program, the other web app

# Final files
- automate printing new invoice to PDF

# Fine tuning
- review functions across projects and get rid of redundancies (especially database related functions)
